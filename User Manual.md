# USER MANUAL

# Safety

Precautions have been taken when housing the electrical components of this device (aka. the motor control boards, the Arduino Mega, the camera, and the motors). Waterproof sealant has been applied on all openings and waterproof containers have been utilized for each component. When performing maintenance on any of the aforementioned elements, please take caution, keep away from water, and ensure that the power has been turned off to avoid shock or malfunction.

Leaking may arise, by means of ware and tear of the tubing or chemical bottles. Please keep up with maintenance and be observant of the surroundings to avoid slip and falls.

Slight shock may arise, by means of ware and tear of the wiring, motors, motor control boards, or Arduino Mega. Following regular maintenance will lower this risk.

Regular calibration of the camera sensor is necessary to avoid unwanted death of the organisms in the aquarium. Allowing the camera to run uncalibrated will increase the chances of false readings and can lead to chemical imbalances.

Keep the “Water Quality Tester” below accompanying aquarium. Positioning the tester above the aquarium may overload the motors, rendering the device ineffective and creating an unnecessary electrical hazard.
